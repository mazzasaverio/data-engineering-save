# Assets

This directory contains images, diagrams, and other media files used throughout the data engineering knowledge base.

## Organization

It's recommended to organize assets by topic or content area:

- `architectures/`: Diagrams related to system architectures
- `concepts/`: Illustrations of data engineering concepts
- `workflows/`: Workflow and process diagrams
- `screenshots/`: Screenshots of tools and interfaces
- `logos/`: Logos of technologies and tools

## File Naming

Use descriptive file names with the following pattern:
- `[topic]-[description].[extension]`

Examples:
- `delta-lake-architecture.png`
- `etl-vs-elt-comparison.svg`
- `data-quality-workflow.jpg`

## Best Practices

1. **Use vector formats (SVG) when possible** for diagrams and illustrations to ensure they remain crisp at any size
2. **Keep images optimized** for web viewing (compress PNGs and JPGs appropriately)
3. **Include alt text references** when linking to images in Markdown files
4. **Create diagram source files** when applicable (e.g., draw.io XML files) alongside rendered images
5. **Maintain consistency** in diagram style and color schemes

## Tools

Recommended tools for creating assets:
- [draw.io](https://draw.io) or [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) for architecture diagrams
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) for hand-drawn style diagrams
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io) for simple diagrams using text notation
